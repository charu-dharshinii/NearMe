    Chennai and its relationship with cafés go way back, and foodies in the city virtually always have new places to try out every day. But in keeping with their USP of innovation, the new coffee shop concentrates on speciality coffees. Some people shun coffee altogether, while others cross the globe searching for the best coffee. Some would claim that coffee is an acquired taste.

Instagram recently boomed with this coffee shop in Anna Nagar that replaced the love for Starbucks among people by offering the best coffee flavours in Chennai until night 12 in the heart of Chennai. A lot of influencers posted and made reels with them making them famous and the talk of the town to be the most hyped place to halt up.

Halt is a very well-liked location in Anna Nagar. What Rohit Balaji and Neeraj Venkatesan first operated as a cart or kiosk is now one of Anna Nagar’s trendiest spots.

There are just four workers in the small, non-seating area, and three of them make the coffee. The coffees originate from an enigmatic decoction bottle and the entire line of Monin’s. To froth the milk, they use an espresso maker as the wand.

“We are making every attempt to transform Chennai’s coffee shop experience through open design and sincere effort. selecting the ideal coffee beans, controlling their shelf life, using precise equipment, and making the entire process transparent to customers. We are dedicated to providing authentic barista services and introducing the contemporary coffee experience to Chennai’s residents.” said Rohit

Coffee and tea prices range from 15 to 25 rupees to less than 150 rupees for the most costly cup. Therefore, it costs at least 100 to 150 rupees less than most cafés that offer late work. There is no seating, which is a good thing because the kids wouldn’t leave if they already stay in.
