    The S.B.O.A Matriculation School was started in June 1983 with classes VI to IX in response to the needs of many pupils who wanted to pursue their studies according to the Matriculation School Syllabus of the Tamil Nadu Government. After getting the recognition from the Government, Std X was started and the HIGHER. SECONDARY Section added on later. In 1994 the school was shifted to a separate building. The first batch of students appeared for Std X Matriculation Examination in 1985 and scored 100% result. The results continue to be excellent in both Std X & XII ever since.
    Realizing the great demand for education at the lower level, the Primary section was opened in the school campus in June 1986. The Primary section consists of classed LKG to V. With the addition of the Primary section, the S.B.O.A Matriculation & Higher Secondary School became a full-fledged school in all respects.
